          <p>Hi, I'm Ava. I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for
            technology, learning, and creating.<br></br>
              Currently based in London, United Kingdom.</p>
          <p>Creative arts - I have dedicated most of my life to the creative arts, specifically in music, where I
            achieved the most out of all of my creative endeavours. Some highlights of my music career were playing
            national shows, playing sets and featuring on various online Radio such as NTS and Radar Radio,
            collaborating with artists from all over the world, directing my own music videos, and earning 265K
            plays in total on SoundCloud. I am self-taught in screenwriting and have written two feature-length film
            scripts. Last year I released a short poetry anthology and I currently write on Substack. I am also in
            the process of creating my first few video essays, which aim to analyse media. I am extremely passionate
            about writing, collaborating with others sonically and cult films and have succeeded in all of these
            areas in my own way.
            The humanities - I have a love for history, specifically history of art, which is why I have a small
            Instagram page dedicated to my own personal curation of my favourite moments in art history. I am also
            passionate about Western Philosophy, language learning, psychology and logical reasoning in social
            politics.
            Interests and more about me:
            I have dedicated most of my life to the creative arts, specifically in music, where I achieved the most out of all of my creative endeavours. Some highlights of my music career were playing national shows, playing sets and featuring on various online Radio such as NTS and Radar Radio, collaborating with artists from all over the world, directing my own music videos, and earning over 265K plays in total on SoundCloud. I am self-taught in screenwriting and have written two feature-length film scripts. Last year, I self-published a short poetry anthology and I currently write on Substack. I am extremely passionate about writing, collaborating with others sonically, cult cinema, and have succeeded in all of these areas in my own way. I also have a love for languages and the humanities, and have taught myself a lot about these subjects in recent years. I hope to carry on growing my knowledge in all areas I am interested in, both technical and artistic in the years to come.</p>
